Heap is a:

1. complete tree (every level of the tree got two child except the last level)
2. children are added to each level from left to right
3. usually implemented as arrays
4. the maximum or minimum value will always be at the root of the tree (advantage of using Heap)
5. heapify: process of converting a binary tree into a heap
